## Summary

- Policy search (reinforcement learning) to learn control for robot tasks
- Deep learning for learning features from low-level observations (joint angles + camera images) to joint torques
- a

------------------

## Reinforcement Learning

- Set of (agent/environment) states $S$, set of actions $A$
- Action transitions $s_t$ to $s_{t+1}$ with reward $r_{t+1}$
- Maximise expected return (sum of rewards) $R$ given policy $\pi$: $E[R|\pi]$
